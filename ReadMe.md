## Relational Database Design Project

This repository contains my final submission for the Relational Database Design Project. The project involved the creation of a relational database using data from the OWID COVID-19 vaccination dataset. Key project details include:

- **Source Data:** The database files were sourced from the [OWID COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations).
- **Data Files Used:** These data files were used for the project: locations.csv, us_state_vaccinations.csv, vaccinations-by-age-group.csv, vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv, vaccinations.csv, country_data/Australia.csv, country_data/Germany.csv, country_data/England.csv, and country_data/France.csv.
- **Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning procedures involved the use of tools like Microsoft Excel Queries for tasks such as data pivoting and splitting.
- **Relational Database:** The database was designed and implemented in SQLite, and it was populated with the relevant data.
- **Queries and Visualization:** The project included the execution of five queries, including some abstract ones, using the database. Data visualizations were also created using Microsoft Excel.

For more in-depth project information, you can explore the following project components:

- **Database Design Format:** Refer to the detailed database design format in [models.pdf](models.pdf).
- **Database Creation Script:** The script for creating the relational database can be found in [database.sql](database.sql).
- **Queries and Results:** The SQL queries and their corresponding results are available in [queries.sql](queries.sql) and [queries.pdf](queries.pdf) respectively.
- **Database Final Implementation:** The final database can be found in [Vaccinations.db](Vaccinations.db). This is for use in SQL Lite.

This project showcases my skills in database design, data management, and data querying, along with proficiency in data visualization and analysis.
