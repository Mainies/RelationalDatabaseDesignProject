This git repository holds my final submission for the Relational
Database Design Project.

The task was to take the certain data files from:

https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

The database files were:
-locations.csv
-us_state_vaccinations.csv
-vaccinations-by-age-group.csv
-vaccinations-by-manufactuer.csv
-vaccinations.csv
-country_data/Australia.csv
-country_data/Germany.csv
-country_data/England.csv
-country_date/France.csv

The data from these files had to be designed into a relational database.
This database was then created in SQLite and populated using the above data.
To clean the data I used a range of tools in Microsoft Excel Queries such as
pivoting and splitting to be able to import into SQLlite.

We were then required to complete 5 (in some cases abstract) queries using this
database and create a data visualisation in Excel.

The database design format can be found in models.pdf, the queries to
create the database is in database.sql and the code to answer the queries
requirements is in queries.sql with the results in queries.pdf.
