### Relational Database Design Project

This repository holds my final submission for the Relational Database Design Project. The task involved taking data files from the OWID COVID-19 vaccination dataset and designing a relational database. Key details:

- Database files from: [OWID COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations)
- Database files used: locations.csv, us_state_vaccinations.csv, vaccinations-by-age-group.csv, vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv, vaccinations.csv, country_data/Australia.csv, country_data/Germany.csv, country_data/England.csv, country_data/France.csv
- Data cleaning involved using tools such as Microsoft Excel Queries for pivoting and splitting.
- The relational database was created in SQLite and populated with the data.
- Five queries (including some abstract ones) were completed using this database, and data visualizations were created in Excel to meet assessment guidelines.
